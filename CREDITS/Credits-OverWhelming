Tracer model by Revilution\Zanieon, texture happily snapped from Quake 4 (ID Software)

Sprites:
Source - Brink (Splash Damage)
Rip - Sinael
Refinement by me, Pillow!

Sounds:
Up, health racking up - Epic Games (UT99)
Rev up, fire, stop down on both fire modes - Valve (Left 4 Dead)
AddLoop - Call of Duty (Infinity Ward)
Additional firing clip - ? (I got those from FPSBanana before it ker-crashed and turned into Gamebanana, soooo... couldn't find them again.)
