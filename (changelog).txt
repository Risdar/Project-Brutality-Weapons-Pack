Assembled by RENEGADE ANDROiD.

**Top Tier Weapons Collection** - *Project Brutality 0.3.X Staging*

Includes **Doorbuster** + **45+ Enabled weapons** (and disabled extras if you really love choice paralysis)

Assembled using **Insanity's Nightmare** as a base & combined with **Demon Tech**, **Fire & Ice** (incl. **Behold**, *Shieldsaw Toss, custom monsters*), *CSSG, Paingiver, Gauss Cannon, CryoShotgun, Demonic Exterminator, D2016 SuperShotgun, Mastermind Chaingun, Ancient Crossbow, UAC Super Nailgun, M2 Excavator, Marauder SSG, UAC 320 Heavy Machine Gun, 50B Bolt-Action Sniper, M41A Alien Pulse Rifle, M1887 Winchester, three Doom 4 Weapons, Ballista, Calamity Blade, Argent Sith Beam* (new version collaboration with @warcarlsson) + **Gadgets and Equipment**. 

Adjustments:
- Clean, organized package for improved performance.
- Tweaked HUD (lower left/right corners are "beefier" than PB's default)
- Added kick and slide weapon sprite animations to Hellpistoler and HASG.
- Added the ability to perform Fatalities when clicking Fire for most all addon weapons.
- Fixed sprite sharing conflicts.
- Removed Explosive ammo type from HASGdrum selecion due to a consistent VM Abort fatal error.
- Added new Class and Decorate spawners by @warcarlsson : Enemies will only drop ammo and upgrades for weapons instead of weapons, improving performance.  Addon weapons will still have a chance to spawn normally on maps.
- Enabled additional weapon spawners.
- All weapons can be dropped.
- All weapons can be given with Ultimate Cheat Menu's "Give Weapons"

Known Issue: PB's M2 Plasma Rifle somehow has an issue with its' Fire state even tho there's no file for it in this addon overwriting it.  Using Quick Melee allows you to use Fire state until the next Reload.

I use UZDoom.
